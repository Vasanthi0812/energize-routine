 Overview  
The "Weekly Workout Planner" is a React.js web application designed to help users follow a structured 7-day workout routine based on their selected difficulty level. This app is built to be simple, user-friendly, and visually appealing with smooth animations, interactive UI elements, and a minimalist design.  

Each day of the plan focuses on a different muscle group while maintaining a warm-up session every day. The app provides a seamless workout experience without requiring a backend or database, making it lightweight and fast.  

## Project Goals  
- Create an intuitive weekly fitness planner that offers balanced workouts.  
- Ensure a smooth user experience with animations and clean UI design.  
- Keep the app fully frontend-based using localStorage for progress tracking.  
- Provide aesthetic color schemes for a modern and fresh look.
